# static-site-generator

This is a simple static site generator built in Python.

The generator pulls the `markdown` files from the `/content` directory and other css/images from the `/static` directory to generate a full-pages HTML website.

The project is hosted on GitHub Pages, please check the [real demo site](https://xavier-hsiao.github.io/static-site-generator/)
